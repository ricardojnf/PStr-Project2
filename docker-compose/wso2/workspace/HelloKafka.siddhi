@App:description('Consume events from a Kafka Topic and publish to a different Kafka Topic')

/*

Purpose:
    This application demonstrates how to use the Kafka transport in Siddhi to receive and publish events. Events which are in JSON format are consumed from one Kafka topic and written to another Kafka topic in XML format.

Executing the Sample:
    1) Start the Siddhi application by clicking on 'Run'
    2) If the Siddhi application starts successfully, the following messages would be shown on the console,
        * HelloKafka.siddhi - Started Successfully!

Suppose that the factory packs sweets by taking last 3 sweet productions disregarding their individual amount.

6th events of SweetProductionStream will be the 2nd event of TotalStream
