In this section we briefly go over each query, explain the results we got and explain if they we're expected or not. The results of running each query will be in the zip file containing our implementation.

\subsection{Q1}
From the results of running Q1 we notice that the most popular pickup and drop off locations reside in the middle of the grid, that is in the center of the city, which is what we expect, to exist more movement of people in the city center.

Event{timestamp=1624024803157, data=[156, 160, 155, 162, 411], isExpired=false}]

\subsection{Q2}
From running Q2 we observe, now in a new grid, that the most profitable areas are placed in the center of the grid, and therefore in the center of the city. This makes sense after observing the most frequent routes in Q1 are also in the center of the city.

This was expected because to calculate the most profitable areas we need to divide the zones with the most rides divided by the empty taxis in that area. And the empty taxis in an area is low as we can observe next in Q3.

\subsection{Q3}
From observing our implementation of Q3 running we didn't observe any alerts which means that the average idle time of taxis in New York doesn't grow very large, we used 10 minutes as a threashold. This is given to the constant movement and affluence of people in the city, which is one of the most densely populated in the world.

\subsection{Q4}
In Q4 we detect that the most congested areas are again in the center of the grid and that is due again to the bigger concentration of people in the city center and typical New York traffic.

\subsection{Q5}
From observing the results of Q5 we infer that the biggest tips of the last 24 hours are usually just above 100 dollars. In the first 24 hours we detect a tip of 531 dollars, though.
