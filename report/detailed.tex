In this section we present in more detail one of the answered questions, presenting the code and the rationale behind the decisions taken. The question we are going to present is Q4: \textit{"Detect congested areas"}.\par

define stream CongestedAreasStream (pick_lon_grid long, pick_lat_grid long);

For this question we use 4 streams to process the data, where RawInputStream is the stream that takes the data directly from the dataset's csv and CongestedAreasStream is the output stream where it gives us the answers of which are the most congested areas.\par

\begin{lstlisting}
__________
@info(name='query2')
from RawInputStream
select medallion, math:round((pickup_longitude - (-74.916578)) /  (0.005986 / 2)) as pick_lon_grid, 
math:round((41.47718278 - pickup_latitude) /  (0.004491556 / 2)) as pick_lat_grid, 
math:round((dropoff_longitude - (-74.916578)) /  (0.005986 / 2)) as drop_lon_grid, 
math:round((41.47718278 - dropoff_latitude) /  (0.004491556 / 2)) as drop_lat_grid, 
trip_time_in_secs
insert into GridInputStream;
__________
\end{lstlisting}

Using the formulas presented above, we transformed the longitude and latitude coordinates into grid cells, thus selecting the trip pickup and dropoff grid cells and also the medallion and the trip time (\textit{$trip_-time_-in_-secs$}), inserting the data in the GridInputStream stream.

\begin{lstlisting}
__________
@info(name='query3')
from GridInputStream [ pick_lon_grid >= 0 and pick_lon_grid <= 600 
	and pick_lat_grid >= 0 and pick_lat_grid <= 600 and 
	drop_lon_grid >= 0 and drop_lon_grid <= 600 and 
	drop_lat_grid >= 0 and drop_lat_grid <= 600 ]
select medallion, pick_lon_grid, pick_lat_grid, 
	drop_lon_grid, drop_lat_grid, trip_time_in_secs
insert into FilteredGridInputStream;
__________
\end{lstlisting}

Then we filter only the events whose dropoffs and pickups occur with a latitude cell greater than zero and less than 600 and a longitude cell greater than zero and less than 600, inserting the same attributes of GridInputStream in FilteredGridInputStream.\par

\begin{lstlisting}
__________
@info(name='query7')
from every e1=FilteredGridInputStream 
    -> e2=FilteredGridInputStream[e1.pick_lon_grid == e2.pick_lon_grid and 
    					e1.pick_lat_grid == e2.pick_lat_grid and 
    					e2.trip_time_in_secs > e1.trip_time_in_secs]
    -> e3=FilteredGridInputStream[e2.pick_lon_grid == e3.pick_lon_grid and 
    					e2.pick_lat_grid == e3.pick_lat_grid and 
    					e3.trip_time_in_secs > e2.trip_time_in_secs]
    -> e4=FilteredGridInputStream[e3.pick_lon_grid == e4.pick_lon_grid and 
    					e3.pick_lat_grid == e4.pick_lat_grid and 
    					e4.trip_time_in_secs > e3.trip_time_in_secs]
    within 10 sec
select e1.pick_lon_grid, e1.pick_lat_grid
insert into CongestedAreasStream;
__________
\end{lstlisting}

Finally, over the last 10 seconds, we used a logical pattern, selecting the areas that had a sequence of four trips, all increasing in duration, accessing the values in \textit{trip$_-$time$_-$in$_-$secs}. In this way we identify areas that have had a peak in travel time and are therefore the most congested areas.\par
We insert the results into the \textit{CongestedAreasStream}, which is the output stream that prints the results to the console (as it was defined with \textit{\@sink(type='log')})
