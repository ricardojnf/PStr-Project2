In this section we individually present the interpretation and rationale for our solutions.

\subsection{Question 2}

Question 2 is intended to: \textit{"Identify areas that are currently most profitable for taxi drivers"}.\par
For this, we start by dividing the map into a 600x600 grid. To identify the most profitable areas, we divided the profit made in that area by the number of empty taxis.
For each area we calculate the average profit in that area, where we consider the sum of fares plus the sum tips (using the aggregation function \textit{sum}) dividing by the number of trips (using the aggregation function \textit{count}), in each area in the last 15 minutes.\par
To calculate the number of empty taxis, we selected, for each taxi, its highest dropoff$_-$datetime, in the last 30 minutes, and for each area we count the taxis, using the aggregation function \textit{count}.\par
For the presentation of results, we sorted by average profit, descending, selecting only the first five results. 

\subsection{Question 4}

Question 4 is intended to: \textit{"Detect congested areas"}.\par
For this query, as in query 2 we split the map into a 600x600 grid. To identify the most congested areas, we chose to identify the areas with the longest average travel time. For this, for each area where the pickup occurred, we calculated the average time of trips that started in that area, accessing the values in \textit{trip$_-$time$_-$in$_-$secs}, using the aggregation function \textit{avg}. \par
For the presentation of results, we sorted by average trip time, descending, selecting only the first five results. 

\subsection{Question 5}

Question 5 is intended to: \textit{"Select the most pleasant taxi drivers"}.\par
For this query, the solution was quite simple. To select the most pleasant taxi driver, we grouped by taxi driver, adding (using the aggregation function \textit{sum}) the tips received by the taxi driver on all trips that occurred in the time window. Then, sorting by the tip value in a descending way, just select the taxi driver that is at the top, using "\textit{limit 1}".
